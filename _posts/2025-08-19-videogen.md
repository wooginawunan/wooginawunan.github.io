title: Blooming Silence - Art Alive Through AI Motion (1)

---

David Hockney's iconic *"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)"* (1972) comes alive through the lens of three different AI video generation platforms. 

> This piece is inspired by the work of David Hockney. I’ve added small creative touches and gentle animation purely as an experiment in learning and expression. It’s shared here in the spirit of appreciation and exploration, not for commercial purposes. All rights to the original artwork remain with the artist.

Prompt used: 


    A gentle ripple spreads across the pool water, shifting softly with light reflections, 
    while the swimmer's body sways ever so slightly as if carried by the water's calm. 
    The standing figure's hair and jacket move faintly in a light breeze. In the background, 
    a soft shimmer of sunlight plays across the hills and trees, giving the whole scene a 
    tranquil, almost breathing quality.

* It presents pretty impressive results to me -- the natural touches on the standing figure's hair and clothes almost perfectly reflect what I imagined -- the calm and smooth, meditative vibe. 
* The "shifting softly with light reflections" effect is beautifully rendered, adding depth to the scene.
* Generally, if just vibe-checking, it aligns exceptionally well with my prompt intentions --> the best instruction-following model among those tested.

* It seems to me that it pays a lot of attention to the coordination between motions of the two persons -- the standing figure's head moves in sync when the swimming guy emerges from the water -- which has both pros and cons to me.
* The motion of the standing figure and all details like his clothes and hair are well-captured, but the movements appear somewhat rigid especially compared to the example above

> Surprise - Veo2 model - NOT quite there yet in terms of intelligence : ) 

* Motion flows quite naturally and smoothly
* Visual details are rendered with impressive quality
* However, there's a noticeable alignment gap between text and video - the standing figure unexpectedly jumps into the water, deviating from the intended scene description
